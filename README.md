Assignment 8A

Write a program that draws an 8 x 8 chessboard, with alternating gray and white squares. You can use the SetTextColor and Gotoxy procedures from the Irvine32 library. Avoid the use of global variables, and use declared parameters in all procedures. Use short procedures that are focused on a single task.

Assignment 8B

This exercise extends Exercise 9. Every 500 milliseconds, change the color of the colored squares and redisplay the board. Continue until you have shown the board 16 times, using all possible 4-bit background colors. (The white squares remain white throughout.)
